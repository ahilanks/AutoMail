AUTO MAIL

Mail Merging is pretty useful. You can reach out to clients for your newly started consulting business, investors for your new startup, or simply reach out for a coffee chat with industry profesionals. But despite the ease of mail merging, it can be made better.

Auto Mail streamlines the mail merging process. Simply, add the full names of the people you want to reach out to in one column and the companies they work at in another. Click on the Auto Mail extension and add your resume or your organization's personal documentaiton and it does the rest. 

Auto Mail finds the email address of the individual based on the name and company and the confidence of that email being correct. Then, for each indivdiual listed, a personalized email is drafted based on their information and your own information. These details are autopopulated into the spreadsheet.

Go back to gmail, type in a subject header, simply write {{Content}} in the email's body, and click send!
